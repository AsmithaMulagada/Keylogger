Keylogger
Instructions:
A new file has been created called keylogger.py in visual studio.
Importing a module pynput, it is a library used to capture key events from the user. So, for this we have to install pynput using the command py -m pip install pynput.
Python code has been written for keylogger.
Now we execute the program and see the output.
Start giving some text in the terminal so that it should print to the console and log it to the file which has been created automatically when we start entering the text.
If we open and see the file, all the text which we have typed will be logged.

Real world example:
Open google and search for anything eg. facebook. When we open facebook we see a login page and we start entering our credentials so now the keylogger logs everything in the file.

Libraries:	pynput
Instructions:		keyPressed - To log all the typed data.
		          	Keyfile â€“ To stored the logged strokes.
